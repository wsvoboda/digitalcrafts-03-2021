        <p>My name is Whitney and I live in Grapevine, TX. I enjoy traveling in my free time. My favorite place to travel is probably Africa! I was a Peace Corps volunteer from 2008 to 2010 in Burkina Faso. I loved living in Burkina Faso and have traveled a bit in Africa since being a volunteer. I hope to return to the continent once the pandemic ends and life returns to normal! I look forward to becoming an adventurer again!</p>

        <p>I recently moved from Midland, TX. I worked in the oilfield from 2011 until 2020, when I lost my job due to COVID and the oil and gas downturn. I held several positions while working in the oilfield, with recruiting being the most recent. I have held a few recruiting positions since leaving my oilfield job in 2020. I have recently discovered that recruiting is not the best career path for me and I'd like to return to doing something more technical.</p>
