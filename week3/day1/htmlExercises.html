            <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>

            <p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>They're useful for displaying losts of stuff</li>
            <li>That's about it</li>
            <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
        </ul>
            When you make a list, do it in this order:
            <ol>
                <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
                <li>if it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
                            <ol>
                                <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <p>Here's a couple ways you can express yourself</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular il tag here</li>
                <i><li>If you want to soun interesting, try this italics tag</li></i>
                <b><li>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</li></b>
            </ul>
            <p></p>You did it! You should be proud of yourself</p>
            <b><i><p>yOu DiD iT! yOu ShOuLd Be PrOuD oF yOuRsElF</p></i></b>
