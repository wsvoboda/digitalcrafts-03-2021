        <p>When I graduated from college, I joined the Peace Corps! I lived in Burkina Faso for about 2 years and taught math. After returning to the US, I worked in the oil and gas industry with the same company for almost 9 years. I worked as an engineer, sales engineer, and eventually became a recruiter. I am now learning to code in order realign my career path and return to a more technical role. Click a link below to learn more about me!</p>
