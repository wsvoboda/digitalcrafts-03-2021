# Create a controlled input field

- You will create two components. One component will be an input field for username and email. You will have a form button that will submit this information.
- As you type in the input fields, you will fire actions that will set the reducer states. There are three reducers for this exercise.
- You will then hit submit which will post the information you typed in and set it to a userInfo object in state. You will then display in a second component the information that is in the userInfo object on that component.
